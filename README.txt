Hi and welcome to my small and short textadventure.

Here you can create your own character, and explore an adventure.
You yourself decide what will happen so try to stay safe.
Follow the story and see how it unfolds!
(The game finishes with the second page of dialogue, for now.)

# Usage
To start the game, open the project in your development environment of choice (eg. PyCharm).
There, open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and type "python manage.py runserver".
After your local server successfully started, you can click the link shown in the terminal, or just open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
in your web browser of choice.
Upon starting, you will be asked to choose a name (please don't choose something real names or obscene / inappropriate),
distribute skill points, and to choose an appearance.
After that you can start the game, follow the story and decided what choices your character will make. Enjoy!
(You can move freely through the story, so don't worry if you make the wrong choice.)

# Sad Things

1. The Character Pictures sometimes don't show up. I do not know why.
Switching the browser or restarting the server sometimes does the trick. Sometimes not.

2. The Character Pictures don't get saved, since they aren't in the form. I do not know how to include them there (yet).

3. Choosing to shout at the first option is the only real way to advance (for now). Other options have not been explored (yet).
