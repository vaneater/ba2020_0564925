Hi and welcome to my small and short Text Adventure.

# Usage
To start the game, open the project in your development environment of choice (eg. PyCharm).
There, open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and type "python manage.py runserver".
After your local server successfully started, you can click the link shown in the terminal, or just open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/" in your web browser of choice.
Upon starting, you will be asked to choose a name (please don't choose something real names or obscene / inappropriate),
and to choose your favorite kind of activity.
After that you can start the game, follow the story and decided what choices your character will make. Enjoy!

# Sad Things

1. Choosing an activity has no effect on the story (yet).

2. Don't use this Application simultaneously, since that will sadly cause errors.
