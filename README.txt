# ba2020_564925 textadventure

Hi and welcome to my small and short textadventure.

# Usage
To start the game, open the project in your development environment of choice (eg. PyCharm).
There, open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and type "python manage.py runserver".
After your local server successfully started, you can click the link shown in the terminal, or just open "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
in your web browser of choice.
Upon starting, you will be asked to choose a name (please don't choose something real names or obscene / inappropriate),
and to choose your favorite kind of activity.
The activity you choose makes it possible, or impossible for you to take certain options.
After that you can start the game, follow the story and decided what choices your character will make. Enjoy!
(You can move freely through the story, so don't worry if you make the wrong choice.)

# Sad Things

1. Some pictures sometimes don't show up until you open them individually to let them load.

2. Choosing to shout at the first option is the only real way to advance (for now). Other options have not been explored (yet).

3. Choosing an activity has no effect on the story (yet).
