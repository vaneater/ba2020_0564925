<div class="story">
	<p> Your ears are buzzing. It hurts. </p>
	<p> Different sounds enter your mind, as high pitched noise is starting to fade away. There is the rustling of the trees.  </p>
	Their branches cracking in a strong breeze. You hear birds chirping their favorite songs. They sounds so peacful and happy.
	<p> A smell enters your nose. Green grass, muddy earth, musty woods. You slowly open your eyes, adjusting to the light. </p>
	<p> Yeah, you are deep deep inside a forest. But... How did you end up here? You are trying to remember the last thing you did. </p>
	Sitting at a table. Hands rushing through keys. A big spacious room, full with other people.
	<p> A lecture. You were sitting inside a room listening attending your class. But now... How did this happen? </p>
	<p> You look around, trying to find something, anything that may help you get a hold of this situation.
		But there's only trees. Not a sign of civilization. </p>
	<p> Looking down, you notice a sword and a book lying to each of your sides. There is also an old backpack,
		and a scabbard, probably for the sword.</p>
	<p> The book looks old als worn. You flip through the pages, but you can't understand the language. The writing doesn't even look familiar.
		There are a few pictures here and there, showing someone in weird positions... getting hurt?
		Just what could this be? </p>
	<p> You pick up the sword. It doesn't feel as heavy in your hands as you thought it would.
		There is some kind of inscription on the blade, in that same unfamiliar writing. </p>
	<p> Suddenly you see a flock of birds flying out of the forest from your right. Something must have startled them.
		Thinking nothing of it, you try to inspect the two items more, but right then you hear a scream.
		Again, you hear a loud "HELP"...</p>
	<p>	The voice doesn't seem to be that far away. </p>
