<div class="story">
	<p> You have decided to run, ignoring the screams. It can't be safe around here, you have to get away.
		But first, you pack up your new found things.
		It feels weirdly familiar, tossing the backpack with the book inside over your shoulder, and securing the scabbard around your waist.
		Is this really the first time you are handling a sword like this? </p>
	<p> Another scream, there is no time to think. You quickly turn and jog to the opposite direction the voice came from.
		It's not easy making your way through the forest, trying not to trip on tree roots, or getting stuck in thick bushes. </p>
	<p> Eventually you reach a clearing. It's empty, so you continue your way. The wind is getting stronger,
		and the trees around you start swaying uncontrollably. The rustling and cracking of the branches sounds scary.
		Will it be safe to enter the forest again? </p>
	<p> You have no time to think about that, as a figure emerges out of the woods. You halt, as it slowly walks towards you. </p>
	<p> It is not safe, here it's not safe, you are not safe. This darkly dressed person emits and enormous aura of danger.
		You notice the two daggers they are holding. This is definitely not good, no no no. </p>
	<p> Panicking you look around. What are you supposed to do? What CAN you do?  </p>
	<p> And then you feel warmth. Your back... the backpack, no book? And also on your side... the sword.
		It seems like your choices are very limited. </p>
